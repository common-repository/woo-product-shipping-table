While shopping on any ecommerce store, we often buy items which are delivered from different cities or states to us. Sometimes, this causes us to pay some extra price for them in the form of shipping charges.

As for a seller, shipping charges can convert a profitable sales conversion into a loss, if not calculated properly.

To avoid this, we created the TABLE RATE SHIPPING PLUGIN. With this plugin, you can set custom shipping charges that will be applied every time an order is placed.

This plugin allows the admin to add or remove shipping charges on each product. These charges can be customized depending on the zones where the delivery will take place, the number of items or orders, the total weight of the items or the cart total.
